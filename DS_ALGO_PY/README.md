# Data structures and Algorithms with Python.

Here in DS and Algo we will be covering below topics.

* Array Sequences
* Stack Queues and Deques
* Linked Lists
* Recursion
* Trees
* Searching and Sorting
* Graph Algorithms
* Riddles

## **Array Sequences**

An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:
```
car1 = "Ford"
car2 = "Volvo"
car3 = "BMW"
```
