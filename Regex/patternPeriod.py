#period could be used to find pattern if we are not sure about full word
#in this case we can use place period in middle of that,we can see in below eg

pattern='sw..ging'
string = '''
I am black!
I am swinging in the sky,
I am wringing worlds awry;
I am the thought of the throbbing mills,
I am the soul of the soul-toil kills,
Wraith of the ripple of trading rills;
Up Iâ€™m curling from the sod,
I am whirling home to God;
